<h1>Mass Effect home page</h1>
<br>
<p class="center border2">  Welcome to my home page and a quick look at what you are about to see. It is just a few short pages about what I think of the video game Mass Effect (The original trilogy). Below you will see a very quick video of me explaining how I will talk to you about the games and then my conclusion of the series as a whole. My hope here is that dispite I through these videos together that you see how much I understand how the games were made. The fact that I have a huge passion for the series as whole, as I feel like there isn't anything else out there that has the same appeal to me. These three games for me changed the way I look at not only videos as a whole, but life in genral and It really taught me a lot about being a person in a big world (or in the case of the games, a big galaxy) I really do hope you enjoy the presentation I've given you not just the website design but the videos to.
